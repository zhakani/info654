            <h3>Martha Stewart's Saffron-Yogurt Chicken Kebobs</h3>
            <p>This was the first recipe I used to cook chicken by myself. Back in the day when I had a fear of eating undercooked meat and spreading bacteria by handling raw chicken, I felt quite apprehensive to attempt cooking chicken. With the help of this recipe, I knew I didn't have to worry about the taste portion, so I could put all my energy towards the cooking part. As an added bonus, the saffron, the yogurt, and the kebabs felt very reminiscent of South Asian cuisine and made this meal all the more nostalgic!</p>
            <p>The picture on the right is one meal I made with one of my roommates, in which we paired the chicken with basil beet pasta. Believe it or not, it was a hit! This chicken recipe is quite versatile and can be used to top your salads, eaten with rice, or grilled on skewers! Below, you'll be able to locate the ingredient list and directions.  If all else fails, you can use the provided link to the original recipe and follow along from there! Happy Cooking!</p>
            <h3>Ingredient List</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together your yogurt, oil, lemon zest and juice, and all the listed spices (thyme, garlic, saffron, paprica, turmeric, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper).
                <ul>
                    <li>Add in 2 teaspoons of salt and ¼ teaspoon of pepper.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add your chicken into the marinade, make sure all the chicken is coated well. Cover it with plastic and leave it in your refrigerator overnight (if possible).
                <ul>
                    <li>The longer the chicken is able to marinate, the better. At minimum, try to leave the chicken in its marinade for 2 hours.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Prepare whatever you need for the cook, whether it's preheating the grill or heating your pan. Depending on the form you choose, you can start placing the chicken on an oiled pan, or you can thread the chicken onto skewers (with or without vegetables) and grill them on each side until they're cooked through. Drizzle with oil and add salt and pepper as needed.</li>
            <li>Don't forget any sauces, rice, or sides you may want to add to the mix. Serve with lemon wedges and ENJOY!</li>
