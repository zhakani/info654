        <h2>Welcome to iloveNYC</h2>

        <p>We are five graduate students at Pratt Institute who created this website for our Information Technologies
            class in an effort to educate users about New York City’s history and architecture in an interactive and fun
            way. New York City is a major global center for finance, business, culture, technology, and entertainment.
            With about 8.48 million people in July 2024, New York City is the most densely populated major city in the
            U.S.
            About 800 languages are spoken here, making it the most language-diverse city in the world. It sits at the
            southern tip of New York State on one of the world's biggest natural harbors. The city is made
            up of five boroughs, which are also counties. These five boroughs are the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan,
            Queens, and Staten Island.
        </p>
        <p>Manhattan is the smallest borough in size but has the most people living in it. It is the symbol of New York
            City, with most of the city's tall skyscrapers and famous places like Times Square and Central Park.
            Brooklyn is on the western tip of Long Island and is the borough with the most people. Brooklyn is known for
            its many different cultures, people, and art. Queens is the largest borough by land size and the most
            ethnically diverse county in the United States. It is
            also the most diverse urban area in the world! The Bronx is New York City's northernmost borough. You can
            find the Bronx Zoo here, which is the world's
            largest city zoo, covering about 265 acres and housing over 6,000 animals. Staten Island is connected to
            Brooklyn by the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. You can travel to Manhattan by
            taking the Staten Island Ferry.

        <h2>About Our Team</h2>
        <p>This website was created by a group of five Pratt students: Emily Bradley, Gaby Garcia, Zahra Hakani, Samantha Racine, Rose
            Reilly. Collectively, they belong to various programs at Pratt University's School of Information including
            Library & Information Science, Information Experience Design, and Data Analytics & Visualization. Although
            the group comes from different backgrounds and upbringings, they were brought together in the beautiful city
            of New York. In an effort to explore this shared interest and historic place, this website explores the five
            boroughs highlighting architecture and history, with a few fun facts and games sprinkled throughout.</p>
