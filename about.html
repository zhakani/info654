            <h3>Meet Zahra Hakani</h3>
            <p>Hi, this is Zahra! Thank you for visiting my website. My story starts in Atlanta, GA. I was born and raised in the suburbs of Georgia in a household of culinary greatness... a.k.a. my mother's homemade cooking. Unfortunately, I was not lucky enough to acquire the "chef gene", but I do my fair share of contributing by eating. South Asian cuisine started my love for food, it's a labor of love.</p>
            <p>After I moved to the city for college, I was able to explore cuisine outside of my home. I grew a fondness for pho and ramen—the two cannot and should not be confused. I fell in love with classic Southern-style friend chicken, especially with a biscuit for brunch. Most importantly, I found the restaurant that serves the best tiramisu I have ever and will ever consume in my life... it's that good.</p>
            <p>Atlanta was a beautiful start to this food-loving journey. Now, I live in New York City, and food has become the means through which I am able to explore and better understand people, cultures, and experiences. This platform is my food diary. All my explorations including restaurant visits, travel, coffee shops, new recipes, favorite snacks, and so much more can be found here. Hope you enjoy reading all about it!</p>
